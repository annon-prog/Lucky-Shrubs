          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>
            Lucky Shrub, nestled in the heart of Tucson, Arizona, has grown from
            the humble beginnings of a shared love for plants by its founders,
            Jason and Maria. Their journey began as a husband and wife team with
            a passion for transforming outdoor spaces into vibrant, green oases.
            Jason, the garden architect, envisioned a company that combined
            artistry and horticulture. Today, their dream has flourished into a
            medium-sized garden design firm that is a testament to dedication
            and vision. With Jason's expertise in garden design and Maria's
            marketing acumen, they've cultivated Lucky Shrub into a thriving
            business that offers a holistic approach to garden design,
            landscaping, and plant nurturing.
